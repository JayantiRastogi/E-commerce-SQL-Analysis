Problem Statement:
Analyze sales, product, and customer data for an e-commerce company using SQL in BigQuery. The goal is to derive actionable insights and calculate key performance indicators (KPIs) that inform business decisions, focusing on customer behavior, product trends, and sales performance.

Data Dictionary:

  Demographic Table: Contains customer demographic information.
  Transaction Table: Records details of each transaction.
  Products Table: Information about products available for sale.

Approach:

Utilized SQL to uncover insights into customer behavior, sales patterns, and product performance.
Calculated key metrics and KPIs to guide strategic decision-making, such as order value analysis, customer profiling, and revenue trends.
Formulated insights from the analysis and provided recommendations based on the findings.

Analysis points:
  Number of orders categorized by small, medium, or large order value.
  Number of orders by different order value ranges.
  Top 3 stores with the highest foot traffic each week.
  Created a basic customer profile including visits and spending behavior.
  Analyzed the highest spending customer with demographic information.
  Determined the most frequently bought-together product combinations.
  Calculated the weekly change in Revenue Per Account (RPA) using the LAG function.

This project provides an opportunity to refine SQL skills, explore e-commerce data, and generate meaningful insights that can drive business success.
